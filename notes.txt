Game templates version 1.9.1

[test3d]

Contains examples of some basic 3D features:
* displacement mapping
* normal mapping
* stencil shadows
* collision detection, but triangle test still fails occasionally when the collider pushes against the edge between two triangles, causing glitches
* shaders
* render to texture
* parsing and rendering svg fonts with kerning tables. These fonts can be created in fontforge. (http://fontforge.github.io/en-US/)
* using meshes with skeletal animation, created in blender 2.49b (http://www.blender.org/) and exported with the script: xml_exporter.py

[manager]

Need to run this to create account files that the server can parse. It depends on a directory "accounts" residing in the same directory as where the manager runs.

[server]

Runs on the command line, handles requests from the client application. Depends on account files to handle login requests.
Handles public chat messages and updates connected clients about each other's mouse cursor positions.

Install/Uninstall on Windows by running the batch scripts.
Install/Uninstall on unix by running 'make install' as root.

[client]

A graphical interface, that shows a simple login screen. Needs the server to be running in order to let the user log in.
After logging in, users can see each other's mouse cursors and send chat messages to each other.
